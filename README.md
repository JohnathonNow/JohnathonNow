My name is John Westhoff. Friends call me **Jeffrey** for short.  
Online, I like the usernames **JohnBot** and **JohnathonNow**.  
  
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May of 2018, with a BS in Computer Science. Before then,
I lived in [Stanford Hall](http://www3.nd.edu/~stanford/) (<s>pictured above</s><i> well, it would be if GitHub supported it, but for that you'll have to go to <a href="https://www.johnwesthoff.com/about/">my personal site's readme</a></i>).
I once served as the <s>mascot</s> secretary for the 
[Notre Dame Linux Users Group](http://ndlug.org/), and they're
the ones who started calling me Jeffrey.

On October 1st, 2020, I married my wife [breezy](http://bashfulbytes.com/), and the following summer
saw both of us leaving our PhD programs to get full-time jobs due to the trials life threw at us.

I try to keep my blog (mentioned above) updated regularly, but I'm awful at that.
