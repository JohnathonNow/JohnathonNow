### Hi there 👋

My name is John Westhoff. Friends call me **Jeffrey** for short.
Online, I like the usernames **JohnBot** and **JohnathonNow**.<br>
I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May of 2018, with a BS in Computer Science. Before then,
I lived in [Stanford Hall](http://www3.nd.edu/~stanford/) (<s>pictured above<s><i>well, it would be if GitHub supported it, but for that you'll have to go to <a href="https://www.johnwesthoff.com/about/">my personal site's readme</a></i>).
I once served as the <s>mascot</s> secretary for the 
[Notre Dame Linux Users Group](http://ndlug.org/), and they're
the ones who started calling me Jeffrey. After graduating from Notre Dame,
I <s>spent the summer running around chanting "37-0" until the Michigan season opener</s> started
my PhD studies at NYU, where I will be starting my third year in the Fall.

When I'm not writing code, I tend to my diverse hobbies. I like video games,
and I play a wide variety of them when I have the time.  
Recently, I've also taken on 3D printing, and I
haven't yet burnt down my house. Less technically, I've been doing a lot
of woodworking, and have learned about a dozen ways not to make a cup out
of wood.

My fianceeington [breezy](http://bashfulbytes.com/)
is my inspiration for a lot of what I do. We started referring to ourselves as
the CSE Power Couple, and we have worked on some cool projects together. We've also won every
project we've ever worked on together, because everything is a competition if you're a winner.
